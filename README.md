# ml_from_scratch
This project consists of 5 DIY machine learning methods:Classification tree, random forest, adaboost regression tree, gradient boost regression tree and K nearest neighbours, which we rewrite a function repsectively intend to acheive similar output as they could. Also for each method we write a cross validatation function to tune one hyperparameter, finally we include each method with 2 functions in a R package.What's more, we compare the function accuracy compared to the original r package based on a dataset in R called penguins.

#random forest
for this method,
